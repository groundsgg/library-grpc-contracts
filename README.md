# library-grpc-contracts

This repository contains Protocol Buffers (.proto) definitions for all the Grounds gRPC services.

## Release Please

Versioning is owned by Release Please and Git tags. Do not bump versions manually. We must use `go` as the release type (`release-please-config.json`) 
because `gradle` is not supported, and `go` is the only release type that only requires a `CHANGELOG.md`.
